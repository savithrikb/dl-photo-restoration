# PHOTO RESTORATION APP

The main goal of this project is to restore an old tarnsihed photo using Deep Learning (DL) algorithms based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) . For this project, the training dataset will be several old damaged photos as well as several high-quality images that can be found in the "photos/old/" and "photos/new/" directories, respectively.

# Data loading and visualization

As a first step of this project we have to load the data and visualize it. We use the PyTorch ImageFolder and DataLoader classes for this task.
